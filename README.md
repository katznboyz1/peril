*A language learning trivia website that allows users to fully customize the questions that are asked. It also features a competitive mode where the users can compete for points in a game similar to Jeopardy.*

## TODO:

- Make a script that automatically downloads the needed data for the categories.

- Make the web UI (should be statically hosted so that people can run it without a server).

## Build From Scratch:

- Clone this repo, then make a new folder in the same directory as the cloned repo called *"peril"*.

- CD into the cloned repo, then run `cmake ../peril`.

- CD into `../peril` and then run `cmake --build .`.

- Run `./peril`. If everything returns 0, then all your files are there!
